Aggregation Framework

* Old way of doing this kind of stuff was either data warehousing and having SQL run reports or MapReduce
* Aggregation framework uses BSON to declare operations and executes in C++ which takes advantage of multiple cores, etc unlike map reduce which has to fight with other JS stuff for global JS lock
* Pipelines built like UNIX command line (take out of one thing and pipe it into something else)
* Aggregation FW makes Mongo less a data store and gives it powerful analytic tools

* Some pipline operators work like a normal .find query (like $match, $sort, $limit, $skip)
* $project allows for renaming and computing fields. Also can be used to create and extract sub document fields from collections
* $group can group by a field or by the result of a calculation on a field ($avg, $sum, $min, $max, etc)
* $unwind can take values from array fields and explode them out into separate docs

* Lots of expressions available for $project and $group (look at the docs)

Rest of presentation was a few examples

More pipeline operators in the works for future releases. 

$out operator coming that will let you pipe output to new collection (not there yet)

MongoS can route pipeline only to shards that have the data you want if you give it the shard key.

Use cases include replacing map_reduce and group commands, ad-hoc reporting, real-time analytics, and visualization.
