MongoDB in City of Chicago

* The big question that they are attempting to answer is "How to tell the story of a place..."
* Not as simple as it sounds given that most data lives in silos by organization
* Solution: Bring data into one place, make it available in realtime, and try to connect the dots

* Windy grid: spatial/temporal DB setup. Spatial, in that it's generally geolocated and temporal in that it's timestamped

Project seems relatively new but has big goals. Really about connecting the dots.

Built in $within operator was found to be kinda slow. City is working with 10gen to develop 
a better API to filter results after being queried by other types of indexes. 
Apparently, using 2d index with other stuff can slow queries down tremendously. 

Picking shard key is tricky. Have to figure out a key that can put like stuff in similar shards without gotchas.
